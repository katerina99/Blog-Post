        <h2>Are humans ready to face the near future?</h2>
        <p class="p1">
          Have you thought about how life will be in the future using robots for
          daily and more complex tasks? I bet you are feeling enthusiastic as
          our lives will get much easier and less stressful but at the same time
          a little bit more hesitant in trusting machines for certain types of
          tasks. A great example illustrating this ambiguity is the Blowfish, a
          lethal autonomous robot, that can be either useful for military
          attacks or catastrophic when proceeds to attack a civilian population.

          I know you cower in fear in such cases; however, the future is closer
          than we believe it is and soon we need to learn how to co-exist with
          robots. Increasing attention is attracted to the appearance of robots
          to look more like humans, as well as the movements and complexity of
          the activity and tasks that they need to fulfil. At this point, you
          realise the importance of ethics in decision-making and whether robots
          can be programmed to do this.

          Let’s dig a little deeper and grasp how people perceive moral
          reasoning in robots. Psychology suggests that “agency”, which shows
          the ability of a person to think and act in a moral manner, is
          associated with moral trust in taking actions and responsibilities and
          “affective states”, which are related to the ability to respond
          emotionally, are correlated with moral care for them. An interesting
          academic paper comes to mind by showing how a human-like appearance
          and characteristics have an influence on our trust when are
          responsible for taking moral decisions. The experiment is to place a
          dilemma in a humanoid and a mechanical robot with a combination of
          high/low “affect” and “agency” in order to identify the effects of
          them on people’s perception of them in decision-making. The authors
          believed that when the “agency” is high, the participants will trust
          the robots to make moral decisions. Furthermore, the authors argue
          that human-like robots are more likely to be perceived as more
          trustworthy and responsible by people rather than mechanical ones.
          Lastly, the most trust in their morality is expected to be perceived
          in a state where both “agency” and “affect” are high.

          It’s pretty obvious once you think about it, that these hypotheses are
          sensible, but before I share with you the results of this experiment,
          let me remind you that the hypotheses are built based on the
          accumulated knowledge in the field that was collected over the years.
          Let me now tell you the results that all of us were expecting to be
          confirmed and leave the interesting part for the end. The more
          autonomous and self-controlled the robot, the higher the trust from
          the participants as it made them believe that they have the
          capabilities to take these decisions, so the “agency” condition was
          proved and the appearance of the robot, in this case, influenced their
          implicit trust. In the case where the robot has the ability to
          experience and have conscious feelings about a situation, then the
          participants considered them more capable of taking moral decisions
          but at the same time, a higher level of responsibility for their
          actions was attributed to them. Overall, the participants felt safer
          when the human-like robot had high “affect” or “agency” and that the
          ones with high “affect” are to be punished for causing death compared
          to a mechanical robot with low “affect”. In the case of high
          “affectivity”, the experiment results have shown that the robots
          should be punished for their mistakes compared to the ones with low
          “affectivity”.

        <p class="p5">
          Let’s now dive into the unexpected result of participants dedicating
          more explicit trust to the mechanical robots than humanoid robots for
          both high “agency” and high “affect” compared with the low ones. On
          top of this, it was expected that a combination of both “affect” and
          “agency” will increase fully the trust and capability of humanoid
          robots, this was not the case with the separate characteristics to
          achieve this goal, whereas for the mechanical ones their trust and
          capability with both was boosted. According to some theories, this is
          the result of having a defensive attitude when the agents look and
          behave like humans as we perceive them as a thread.
