      <p>
        I am 3rd year Computer Science student at University of Cyprus, and
        currently I am Erasmus student for one year at Linnaeus University of
        Sweden.I am passionate about Game and Web development as both require
        designing and coding skills, that I have developed over time during
        courses that I attended in online platforms. More specifically, I have
        already completed two courses related to web development and on my free
        time I am spending my time watching YouTube videos about game
        development. Learning in this area of interest is my hobby that makes me
        feel relaxed, and that is the main reason that I try to devote as much
        time I can on courses which are critical for my personal development.
        Except for this, I am a member of the Computer Science Club of the
        University of Cyprus were every semester we learn a new skill after
        attending several class lessons.
